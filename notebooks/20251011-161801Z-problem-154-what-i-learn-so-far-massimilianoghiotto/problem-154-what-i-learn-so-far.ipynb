First of all there is the transposition of the matrix `g`\n```python\n *g,=map(list,zip(*g))\n```\nThe expression `zip(*g)` takes rows and turns them into colums, so the `zip` is *excatly* the transpose operator, and `map(list, ...)` ensures that each row is converted back into a list \n\n---\n\n```python\n if max(r.count(2)for r in g)<5:\n```\n\nThis condition checks how many times the number `2` appears in each row.
