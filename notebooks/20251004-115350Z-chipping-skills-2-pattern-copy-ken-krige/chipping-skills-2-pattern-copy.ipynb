This provides a useful comparison tool and I am very grateful for the shared data.\n\nThere is an understanding on kaggle that medal scoring notebooks should not be shared in the last part of the competition. At least, this used to be the case, but I have not participated for years and am not sure if it is written down anywhere or still applies. However, to this end I have taken 2 precautions.\n1. I have chosen tasks that illustrate a strategy, but fall behind top scores reported in the link above. The examples from yesterday and today do trim hundreds of characters off the existing public solutions but fall short of top ones. The task in this notebook takes a current public solution **438 bytes down to 108**, but the reported top solution is only 65! I have no clue how they chip it in from there.\n2. I am **deliberately not merging** these notebooks with public solution datasets to shoot them to the front the `top public score` filter to get copies and likes. That way, by the letter of the law at least, they are not medal-capable solutions.\n\nIn this notebook I will explore the idea of identifying a pattern in a recursive function and then repeating it.  \n\nHaha, it would be easy to beat the top solution to this task if it **really was** 65!","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-02T07:39:47.382992Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-02T07:39:47.383918Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-02T07:39:47.39356Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-02T07:39:47.383884Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-02T07:39:47.392144Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Chop and copy\nMany of the simpler tasks with short solutions involve some form of pattern copy.
