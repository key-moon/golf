So many people have shared public data sets representing hours of hard work and now covering working solutions to all 400 problems. It would not have been possible for me to solve all 400, and I have also learned techniques from some of the solutions, notably [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/garrymoss/golfed-solutions-and-explanations-to-hard-problems) with code explanations from Garry Moss.\n\n\nI am not a good golfer, but I do know that each hole is won or lost in the detail at the end. Many of the public solutions still need to be golfed down to something approaching the top task scores. So I thought I would share some techniques I have found helpful.\n\nIn this notebook I will explore the idea of rotating the grid and solving multiple times. I also hope to do future examples on recursion and regex pattern searches.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Flip and zip\nIn many of the tasks, I have found it easier to solve from only one of the 4 edges, and then rotate.
