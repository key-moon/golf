For every pair of those 4s in the same row, it scans downward to find rows that also have 4s in the same two columns. Whenever such a match is found, it fills all intermediate rows between those columns with 2s, then returns the modified copy.\n\nAfter exploring several examples, I realized that this process could be simplified quite a bit:\n\n1. Fixed Pattern of 4s: The pattern of 4s is always consistent. The rectangles are defined by pairs of vertical borders, so enumerating all 4s and all possible pairs isn’t necessary.\n\n2. In-place Mutation: Since the task only involves filling cells, we don’t actually need to make a copy of the grid. Updating it directly in-place keeps the code shorter and perfectly acceptable for this puzzle (and many similar ones).\n\n3. Caching the Top Boundary: Using d.setdefault((x, y), i) lets us remember the top boundary for each column pair just once.
