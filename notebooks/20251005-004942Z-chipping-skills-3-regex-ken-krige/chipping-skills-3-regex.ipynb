With lots of help from the kaggle community via comments, we managed to improve my proposed solution, eventually matching the top score for the task. The final solution used no recursion!  \n\nWhen I first wrote the code for `task096.py` I used regex and managed to get a solution of 367 bytes, surpassing the then top score of 373. Now the top score has moved up to 325. I am hoping that similar help from readers will get us to 325. Maybe without any regex.  \n\nAfter years of trying to teach students to write elegant code, I find regex a bit of a **mess** in the context of a python solution to one of these tasks. Something in me fights against using regex. So this time I would actually be very happy with a regex-free improvement to a regex notebook.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\nsys.path.append(\"/kaggle/input/google-code-golf-2025/code_golf_utils\")\nfrom code_golf_utils import *","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-04T17:00:23.759548Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-04T17:00:23.759851Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-04T17:00:23.764849Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-04T17:00:23.759829Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-04T17:00:23.763752Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Rack and stack\nFirst we take a look at the data for `task 96`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"task_num = 96\nshow_examples(load_examples(task_num)['test']+load_examples(task_num)['arc-gen'][:2])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-04T17:00:27.391629Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-04T17:00:27.391944Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-04T17:00:27.546588Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-04T17:00:27.391923Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-04T17:00:27.545651Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Visualise First\nI have annotated the output from the `train[0]` example.
