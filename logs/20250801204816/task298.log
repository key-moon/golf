Here’s a very short Python‐golf solution.  It finds the three colors by descending frequency (outer‐frame, next frame, core), and then remaps each cell via the cycle c0→c2→c1→c0.

```python
def p(val_g):val_b=sum(val_g,[]);val_u=sorted({*val_b},key=val_b.count,reverse=1);return[[val_u[(val_u.index(val_x)+2)%3]for val_x in val_r]for val_r in val_g]
```

Explanation (in brief golf style):

1. `val_b=sum(val_g,[])` flattens the grid into a list.  
2. `val_u=sorted({*val_b},key=val_b.count,reverse=1)` collects the three distinct colors and sorts them by descending count → `[c0,c1,c2]`.  
3. For each cell `val_x`, we look up its index in `val_u` and advance by +2 mod 3 (i.e. 0→2, 1→0, 2→1), yielding the desired color‐cycle mapping.
