Here’s a very golf‐y one‐pass solution that (a) finds the unique “plus‐centre” zero cell, (b) finds the one fill‐colour cell, (c) computes the vector from zero‐centre to that cell, (d) marches that vector outwards until we leave the grid, painting as we go:

```python
def p(g):
    R,C=len(g),len(g[0])
    Z=[(i,j)for i in range(R)for j in range(C)if g[i][j]==0]
    for i,j in Z:
        if (i-1,j)in Z and (i+1,j)in Z and (i,j-1)in Z and (i,j+1)in Z:
            r0,c0=i,j;break
    bg=g[0][0]
    for i in range(R):
        for j in range(C):
            if g[i][j]!=bg and g[i][j]!=0:
                r1,c1,clr=i,j,g[i][j];break
        else:continue
        break
    dr,dc=r1-r0,c1-c0
    k=1
    while 1:
        rr,cc=r0+dr*k,c0+dc*k
        if not(0<=rr<R and 0<=cc<C):break
        g[rr][cc]=clr; k+=1
    return g
```

Explanation of the core steps:
1. Collect all zero‐cells in `Z`.
2. Find the “pivot” zero which has zeroes on all four sides.
3. Identify the single fill‐colour cell (`clr`) that isn’t background or zero.
4. Compute the delta `(dr,dc)` from the pivot to that colour cell.
5. Step repeatedly `(r0+dr*k, c0+dc*k)` until off‐grid, painting each with `clr`.
