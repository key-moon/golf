Here’s a short “code‐golf”‐style solution. It finds each rectangular block of 5’s, computes its bounding box, then repaints border/corners/interior as 4/1/2:

```python
def p(g):
 for val_i in range(len(g)):
  for val_j in range(len(g[0])):
   if g[val_i][val_j]==5:
    val_r=val_i
    while val_r+1<len(g) and g[val_r+1][val_j]==5: val_r+=1
    val_c=val_j
    while val_c+1<len(g[0]) and g[val_i][val_c+1]==5: val_c+=1
    for val_y in range(val_i,val_r+1):
     for val_x in range(val_j,val_c+1):
      if g[val_y][val_x]==5:
       g[val_y][val_x]=1 if (val_y in(val_i,val_r) and val_x in(val_j,val_c)) else \
                         4 if (val_y in(val_i,val_r) or val_x in(val_j,val_c)) else 2
 return g
```

Explanation of the key parts:

- We scan the grid until we hit a 5 at `(val_i,val_j)`.
- We grow `val_r` downward and `val_c` rightward to find the full extent of that 5‐block (always rectangular in the tasks).
- We iterate over every cell in that bounding box.  
  - If it’s on one of the four corners, we write `1`.  
  - Else if it’s on an edge (but not a corner), we write `4`.  
  - Otherwise (strictly interior), we write `2`.  
- Finally we return the modified grid.
