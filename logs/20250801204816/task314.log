Here is a very short “code‐golf” solution.  It finds every pair of equal non‐1 cells in the same row or column, computes their midpoint (integer average) and paints that midpoint in the same color.  It uses only variables beginning with `val_` (as requested) and returns the modified grid in place:

```
def p(val_g):
 val_n=len(val_g)
 for val_i in range(val_n):
  for val_j in range(val_n):
   val_v=val_g[val_i][val_j]
   if val_v>1:
    for val_i2 in range(val_i+1,val_n):
     if val_g[val_i2][val_j]==val_v:val_g[(val_i+val_i2)>>1][val_j]=val_v
    for val_j2 in range(val_j+1,val_n):
     if val_g[val_i][val_j2]==val_v:val_g[val_i][(val_j+val_j2)>>1]=val_v
 return val_g
```

Explanation of the key lines:

- We iterate over every cell `(val_i,val_j)` with value `val_v>1`.
- In the first inner loop we look “downward” in the same column for a matching `val_v` at `(val_i2,val_j)`, and if found we compute the midpoint row `(val_i+val_i2)//2` and color it.
- In the second inner loop we look “to the right” in the same row for a matching `val_v` at `(val_i,val_j2)`, and if found we compute the midpoint column `(val_j+val_j2)//2` and color it.
- Finally we return the mutated grid.
