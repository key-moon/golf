Here is a very short, code‐golf style solution.  It finds the unique “fill” color v, counts in which 3×3 block (separated by the rows/cols of 5’s) it appears most often, then clears all v’s elsewhere and fills that block entirely with v:

def p(val_g):
    val_v=next(x for r in val_g for x in r if x not in(0,5));val_h=[0]*9
    for val_i,val_r in enumerate(val_g):
        for val_j,val_x in enumerate(val_r):
            if val_x==val_v:val_h[val_i//4*3+val_j//4]+=1
    val_t=divmod(val_h.index(max(val_h)),3)
    return[[5 if val_x==5 else val_v if (val_i//4,val_j//4)==val_t else 0
            for val_j,val_x in enumerate(val_r)]
           for val_i,val_r in enumerate(val_g)]
