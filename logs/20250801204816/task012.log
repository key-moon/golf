Here is a very short “code‐golf”‐style solution.  It finds every little “+” in the input (a nonzero center whose four orthogonal neighbours all agree), then for each it draws out to a radius of 2:  
– all orthogonal rays (dx·dy==0) in the arm‐colour  
– all diagonal rays (|dx|==|dy|) in the centre‐colour  
onto a fresh zero grid of the same size.

```python
def p(val_g):
    val_r,val_c=len(val_g),len(val_g[0]);val_h=[[0]*val_c for _ in val_g]
    for val_i in range(1,val_r-1):
        for val_j in range(1,val_c-1):
            val_t=val_g[val_i][val_j]
            if val_t and val_g[val_i-1][val_j]==val_g[val_i+1][val_j]==val_g[val_i][val_j-1]==val_g[val_i][val_j+1]:
                val_w=val_g[val_i-1][val_j]
                for val_dx in range(-2,3):
                    for val_dy in range(-2,3):
                        if val_dx|val_dy and (val_dx*val_dy==0 or abs(val_dx)==abs(val_dy)):
                            val_h[val_i+val_dx][val_j+val_dy] = val_t if abs(val_dx)==abs(val_dy) else val_w
    return val_h
