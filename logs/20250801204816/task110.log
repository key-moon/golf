Here’s a compact “flood‐fill”–style solution.  It finds all zero cells and repeatedly replaces any zero that has a nonzero orthogonal neighbor, until no zeros remain.  All local vars (except the parameter g and the literal tuples) are prefixed val_ as requested:

```python
def p(g):
    val_h,val_w=len(g),len(g[0])
    val_ds=((1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1))
    while any(0 in r for r in g):
        for val_y in range(val_h):
            for val_x in range(val_w):
                if not g[val_y][val_x]:
                    for val_dy,val_dx in val_ds:
                        val_i,val_j=val_y+val_dy,val_x+val_dx
                        if 0<=val_i<val_h and 0<=val_j<val_w and g[val_i][val_j]:
                            g[val_y][val_x]=g[val_i][val_j]
                            break
    return g
```

Explanation of the key points:

- We compute the grid height val_h and width val_w.
- We list the four orthogonal directions in val_ds.
- As long as there is at least one 0 in the grid, we scan every cell.
- Whenever we hit a zero, we check its four neighbors; if any neighbor is nonzero, we copy that neighbor’s value into our zero.
- Repeating until there are no zeros left fills the “hole” with the surrounding periodic pattern.
