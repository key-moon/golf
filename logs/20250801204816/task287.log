The transformation simply “fixes” each row by mirroring its left half into its right half so as to restore perfect left–right symmetry (the small “wrong” blocks on the right become copies of the corresponding left–side pixels). Here’s a very short, in‐place Python golf solution (using your `val_` prefix requirement):

```python
def p(g):
    val_m = len(g[0]) // 2
    for val_r in g:
        val_r[val_m:] = val_r[:val_m][::-1]
    return g
```

Explanation:

1. Compute `val_m`, the midpoint of each row.
2. For each row `val_r`, replace its slice from `val_m` to end by the reverse of its left half.
3. Return the now‐symmetrized grid.
