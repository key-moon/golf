Here’s a very short “code‐golf” solution.  It finds all non‐zero rows and columns to extract the fundamental tile, then repeats it to fill the entire grid:

```python
def p(g):
    val_r=[i for i,r in enumerate(g)if 0 not in r]
    val_c=[j for j in range(len(g[0]))if all(g[i][j]for i in range(len(g)))]
    val_t=[[g[i][j]for j in val_c]for i in val_r]
    return [[val_t[i%len(val_r)][j%len(val_c)]for j in range(len(g[0]))]for i in range(len(g))]
```

Explanation of the steps:

1. `val_r` collects the indices of rows that contain no zeros.  
2. `val_c` collects the indices of columns that contain no zeros.  
3. `val_t` is the extracted sub‐grid (the “tile”) at those row/column positions.  
4. Finally we build the output of the same shape as `g` by repeating `val_t` in both directions.
