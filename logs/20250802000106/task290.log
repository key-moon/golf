Here’s a short “golf‐style” solution.  It finds the minimal bounding box of the nonzero region, extracts it, discovers its two values, then swaps them:

```python
def p(g):val_r=[i for i,r in enumerate(g) if any(r)];val_c=[i for i,c in enumerate(zip(*g)) if any(c)];val_m=[r[val_c[0]:val_c[-1]+1]for r in g[val_r[0]:val_r[-1]+1]];val_a,val_b=set(x for R in val_m for x in R);return[[val_b if x==val_a else val_a for x in R]for R in val_m]
```

Explanation of the steps:

1. `val_r` / `val_c`: row‐ and column‐indices that contain any nonzeros  
2. `val_m`: slice out the minimal subgrid covering those rows/columns  
3. `val_a,val_b`: the two distinct colors in that subgrid  
4. return a new grid where every `val_a` ↔ `val_b` is swapped.
