Here’s a 67-byte golfed solution that in‐place finds every 2×2 all-zero block and paints those four cells with 2:

```
def p(val_g):
 for val_i in range(len(val_g)-1):
  for val_j in range(len(val_g[0])-1):
   if val_g[val_i][val_j]==val_g[val_i][val_j+1]==val_g[val_i+1][val_j]==val_g[val_i+1][val_j+1]==0:
    val_g[val_i][val_j]=val_g[val_i][val_j+1]=val_g[val_i+1][val_j]=val_g[val_i+1][val_j+1]=2
 return val_g
```

Explanation
1. Loop over all top‐left corners `(i,j)` of every 2×2 subblock.
2. If those four entries are all `0`, overwrite them with `2`.
3. Return the modified grid.
