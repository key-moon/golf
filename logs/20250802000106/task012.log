Here’s a  golf‐y one‐function solution.  It scans for any “plus” center (a cell whose N/S/E/W neighbors are nonzero), reads its center‐color `C` and arm‐color `A`, and then stamps a 5×5 pattern around it into a fresh zero‐grid.  In that pattern, any offset `(dx,dy)` with `dx*dy==0` and `|dx|+|dy|>0` (i.e. a straight neighbor at distance 1 or 2) gets color `A`, all other offsets in the 5×5 get color `C`.  

```python
def p(g):
 val_r=[[0]*len(g[0])for _ in g]
 for val_i in range(2,len(g)-2):
  for val_j in range(2,len(g[0])-2):
   val_C=g[val_i][val_j];val_A=g[val_i-1][val_j]
   if val_C*val_A*g[val_i+1][val_j]*g[val_i][val_j-1]*g[val_i][val_j+1]:
    for val_di in range(-2,3):
     for val_dj in range(-2,3):
      val_r[val_i+val_di][val_j+val_dj]=val_A if not(val_di*val_dj)and abs(val_di)+abs(val_dj)>0 else val_C
 return val_r
```  

Explanation of the key line inside the 5×5 loops:

 - `not(val_di*val_dj)` is true precisely when one of `dx,dy` is zero → a straight offset.  
 - `abs(dx)+abs(dy)>0` excludes the center itself.  
 - Together these pick out exactly the 8 “arm” positions at Manhattan distance 1 or 2 for color `A`, all other 24 positions in the 5×5 block (16 corners/diagonals plus the center) get `C`.
