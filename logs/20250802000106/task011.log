Here’s a **very** golfed‐down Python solution.  It partitions the 11×11 grid by the “5”‐lines into nine 3×3 blocks, and then *fills each block with its top‐left cell’s value*.  Replace “5” with whatever your separator is if needed.  All other cells (the red separators in your examples) are left untouched.

```python
def p(g):
 val_n=len(g)
 for val_i in range(val_n):
  for val_j in range(val_n):
   if g[val_i][val_j]!=5:
    # find block origin by integer‐dividing by 4 (3 cells + 1 separator)
    g[val_i][val_j]=g[val_i//4*4][val_j//4*4]
 return g
```

Explanation of the key line:

```python
g[val_i][val_j]=g[val_i//4*4][val_j//4*4]
```

– `val_i//4*4` and `val_j//4*4` each compute the row/column of the *top‐left* corner of the 3×3 block containing `(val_i,val_j)`.  
– We then overwrite each non-5 cell with the value found in that corner.  

This reproduces the pattern of uniformly colored 3×3 blocks in the outputs.
