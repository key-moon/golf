A very short “golfy” Python solution that finds the colour appearing in three identical 3×3 blocks, locates one of those blocks, and returns it is:  

```python
def p(g):
 v = max({c for r in g for c in r if c}, key=lambda c: sum(rr.count(c) for rr in g))
 t = sum(r.count(v) for r in g) // 3
 H, W = len(g), len(g[0])
 for i in range(H-2):
  for j in range(W-2):
   s = sum(g[i+a][j+b]==v for a in (0,1,2) for b in (0,1,2))
   if s==t and all(g[i+a][j+b] in (0,v) for a in (0,1,2) for b in (0,1,2)):
    return [row[j:j+3] for row in g[i:i+3]]
```

Explanation in brief:

1. Collect all non‐zero colours and pick the one `v` whose total count in the entire grid is largest (ARC examples always tie the “interesting” shape with the globally most frequent non‐zero colour).
2. Since each shape appears exactly three times in the puzzle, each 3×3 block of that colour contains exactly `t = total_count(v)//3` cells of value `v`.
3. Slide a 3×3 window over `g`; whenever you find one containing exactly `t` cells equal to `v` (and all others 0), you’ve found one of the three identical shape‐blocks. Return it.
