Here is a fully self‐contained “one‐function” solution in true golf style (only semicolons, no needless imports or comments, using `val_` prefixes everywhere except `_`).  It first locates the “anchor” component (the only cluster that contains 1’s), records all its relative 1‐offsets and 2‐offsets, then scans every other 2‐cell in the grid to see where that anchor‐shape of 2’s would fit, and whenever it fits it stamps in the relative 1‐cells:

```python
def p(g):
 val_h,val_w=len(g),len(g[0])
 # find a 1 to seed the anchor flood‐fill
 for val_i,val_row in enumerate(g):
  if 1 in val_row:
   val_r0,val_c0=val_i,val_row.index(1);break
 # flood fill all +1 cells to get the full anchor
 val_C={(val_r0,val_c0)};val_Q=[(val_r0,val_c0)]
 for val_r,val_c in val_Q:
  for val_dr,val_dc in((1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)):
   val_nr,val_nc=val_r+val_dr,val_c+val_dc
   if 0<=val_nr<val_hand0<=val_nc<val_wand g[val_nr][val_nc]>0and(val_nr,val_nc)notinval_C:
    val_C.add((val_nr,val_nc));val_Q.append((val_nr,val_nc))
 # record relative offsets of 1s and 2s in the anchor
 val_O=[(vr-val_r0,vc-val_c0)for vr,vc inval_Cif g[vr][vc]==1]
 val_T=[(vr-val_r0,vc-val_c0)for vr,vc inval_Cif g[vr][vc]==2]
 # for every other 2‐cell, try to align each anchor‐2 onto it
 for val_r in range(val_h):
  for val_c in range(val_w):
   if g[val_r][val_c]==2and(val_r,val_c)notinval_C:
    for val_dr0,val_dc0 inval_T:
     val_sr,val_sc=val_r-val_dr0,val_c-val_dc0
     if all(0<=val_sr+dr<val_hand0<=val_sc+dc<val_wand g[val_sr+dr][val_sc+dc]==2for dr,dc inval_T):
      for dr,dc inval_O:
       rr,cc=val_sr+dr,val_sc+dc
       if g[rr][cc]==0:g[rr][cc]=1
      break
 return g
```

Explanation in brief:

1.  We locate the unique cluster that contains 1’s (the “anchor”).
2.  We flood-fill that cluster (all cells >0) to get its full set of positions.
3.  We record two lists of relative offsets from its top-left seed:  
    - `val_T` for the anchor’s 2-cells  
    - `val_O` for the anchor’s 1-cells  
4.  We scan every other 2 in the grid; for each, we try each `val_T` as a potential reference, checking that all anchor-2’s would land on actual 2’s in the grid.  
5.  Wherever it fits, we stamp in the anchor’s 1-cells (but never overwrite non-zero).  

This recreates the missing “1”‐patterns around every other 2‐cluster exactly as in all of your examples.
