Here is a fully “golfed” one‐liner (all variables start with `val_` except the throwaway `_`), which locates the color that occurs exactly four times, finds the two that share a row and the two that share a column, and then draws that cross on an otherwise zero grid:

```python
def p(val_g):
 val_y,val_x=len(val_g),len(val_g[0]);val_v=[val_g[val_i][val_j]for val_i in range(val_y)for val_j in range(val_x)if val_g[val_i][val_j]];val_c=next(val_t for val_t in set(val_v)if val_v.count(val_t)==4);val_p=[(val_i,val_j)for val_i in range(val_y)for val_j in range(val_x)if val_g[val_i][val_j]==val_c];val_r=next(val_rr for val_rr in set(val_i for val_i,_ in val_p)if [val_ii for val_ii,_ in val_p].count(val_rr)>1);val_cs=[val_jj for _,val_jj in val_p];val_cc=next(val_cc for val_cc in set(val_cs)if val_cs.count(val_cc)>1);val_o=[[0]*val_x for _ in range(val_y)];[val_o[val_i].__setitem__(val_cc,val_c)for val_i in range(val_y)];val_o[val_r]=[val_c]*val_x;return val_o
```

Explanation sketch (inline comments removed to save space):

1. Scan all non‐zero entries into `val_v`.
2. Pick the entry `val_c` whose count is exactly 4.
3. Gather its four positions into `val_p`.
4. From those, find the repeated row `val_r` and the repeated column `val_cc`.
5. Build a zero grid `val_o`, draw the vertical line at `val_cc` and the horizontal line at `val_r` in color `val_c`, and return it.
