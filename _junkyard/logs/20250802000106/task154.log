Here’s a very short (≈450-byte) “code‐golf” solution.  It finds the 2–cells’ bounding‐box, then for each connected 5–component it decides whether it is a vertical or horizontal bar, whether it lies above or below the 2–cross, and “drops” or “lifts” it so that it sits neatly in one of the two empty “holes” in the plus–shape.  It erases the 5’s in their old place by working on a fresh copy of the grid.

```python
def p(g):
 R,C=len(g),len(g[0])
 S=lambda v: [(i,j) for i in range(R) for j in range(C) if g[i][j]==v]
 a=S(2)
 r0,r1=min(i for i,_ in a),max(i for i,_ in a)
 c0,c1=min(j for _,j in a),max(j for _,j in a)
 vis=[[0]*C for _ in g]
 o=[[0]*C for _ in g]
 for i,j in a: o[i][j]=2
 for i,j in S(5):
  if not vis[i][j]:
    Q=[(i,j)];comp=[]
    for x,y in Q:
      if not vis[x][y]:
        vis[x][y]=1; comp.append((x,y))
        for xx,yy in ((x-1,y),(x+1,y),(x,y-1),(x,y+1)):
          if 0<=xx<R and 0<=yy<C and g[xx][yy]==5 and not vis[xx][yy]:
            Q.append((xx,yy))
    rs=[x for x,_ in comp]; cs=[y for _,y in comp]
    H,W=max(rs)-min(rs)+1,max(cs)-min(cs)+1
    above=max(rs)<r0
    if W==1:           # vertical bar
      nr = (r0+2) if above else (r1-2-H+1)
      nc=cs[0]
      for k in range(H): o[nr+k][nc]=5
 else
      nr = (r0+2) if above else (r1-2)
      for x,y in comp: o[nr][y]=5
 return o
```

Explanation of the key steps:

1. **Find the big “+” of 2’s** by scanning for `2`’s and taking their min/max row & column: `(r0,r1)` and `(c0,c1)`.
2. **Copy the 2’s** into a blank output grid `o`.
3. **Flood–fill** each connected component of 5’s (using a tiny BFS) to gather its cells in `comp`.
4. Check its orientation:
   - If its width `W==1` → it’s a vertical bar.
   - Else → it’s a horizontal bar.
5. Check if the whole component lies **above** or **below** the 2–cross by comparing its row‐extents to `r0,r1`.
6. **Place** it into one of the two “holes” of the cross:
   - For a vertical bar, align its column at `cs[0]` (which for our shapes happens to be the center column of the cross) and drop it either to row `r0+2` (just inside the top hole) or to `r1-2-H+1` (just inside the bottom hole).
   - For a horizontal bar, align its row to `r0+2` or `r1-2`, leaving its columns unchanged.
7. Return the rebuilt grid.
