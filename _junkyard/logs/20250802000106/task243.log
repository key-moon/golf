Here's a very short golfed solution.  It walks each row, finds the indices of all non‐zero cells, then fills all zeroes between every pair of consecutive non‐zero entries with 1:

```python
def p(val_g):
    for val_r in val_g:
        val_nz=[i for i,v in enumerate(val_r) if v]
        for val_i,val_j in zip(val_nz,val_nz[1:]):
            for val_k in range(val_i+1,val_j):
                if val_r[val_k]==0: val_r[val_k]=1
    return val_g
```

Explanation:
1. For each row `val_r`, collect the list `val_nz` of indices of non‐zero entries.
2. For each adjacent pair `(val_i,val_j)` in that list, iterate `val_k` from `val_i+1` up to (`val_j`−1).
3. Whenever `val_r[val_k]` is 0, set it to 1.
4. Return the modified grid.
