Here’s a very short “golfed” Python solution.  It finds the two all-same‐color vertical “bars” (non-zero columns), then the two all-same-interior‐color horizontal “bars” (non-zero rows between those columns), and crops to that rectangle (including the bars themselves):

```
def p(val_g):
 val_bs=[vj for vj,vc in enumerate(zip(*val_g)) if len({*vc})==1 and vc[0]]
 val_c1,val_c2=val_bs
 val_rs=[ri for ri,row in enumerate(val_g) if len({*row[val_c1+1:val_c2]})==1 and row[val_c1+1]]
 val_a,val_b=val_rs[0],val_rs[-1]
 return [r[val_c1:val_c2+1] for r in val_g[val_a:val_b+1]]
```

Explanation of key steps:

- Enumerate columns via `zip(*val_g)`.  Pick those `vc` with exactly one unique value (`len({*vc})==1`) and not zero.  These are our left/right bars → `val_bs`.
- Between those bars, look at each row’s interior slice `row[val_c1+1:val_c2]`.  Rows where that slice is a single non-zero color mark the top/bottom bounds → `val_rs`.
- Crop rows from `val_a` to `val_b` and columns from `val_c1` to `val_c2` (inclusive).
