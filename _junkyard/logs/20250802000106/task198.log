Here’s one compact “golf‐style” routine.  It

1.  Finds the “heavy” rows/cols (they’re the separators),  
2.  Breaks the grid into small sub‐blocks,  
3.  Sees where a zero appears in a separator (a hole) to link two blocks,  
4.  Union‐finds all the blocks,  
5.  Picks the biggest connected component to color “4” and all the rest “3,”  
6.  Leaves the separators (nonzero in) untouched.  

(It always re-uses “3” and “4” for the two fill colors.)

```python
def p(g):
    h,w=len(g),len(g[0])
    # sepVal = the nonzero that forms the grid lines
    sv=next(x for r in g for x in r if x)
    # heavy rows/cols are the separator lines
    Rs=[i for i in range(h) if g[i].count(sv)>w/2]
    Cs=[j for j in range(w) if sum(g[i][j]==sv for i in range(h))>h/2]
    # build the breakpoints: -1, all Rs, h  (and same for Cs)
    Rb=[-1]+Rs+[h]; Cb=[-1]+Cs+[w]
    nr, nc=len(Rb)-1, len(Cb)-1
    # union-find
    P=list(range(nr*nc))
    def f(x):
        while P[x]!=x: x=P[x]
        return x
    def u(a,b):
        a,b=f(a),f(b)
        if a!=b: P[a]=b
    # holes in horizontal separators link block(i,j)<->block(i+1,j)
    for r in Rs:
        i=sum(1 for x in Rs if x<r)
        for c in range(w):
            if g[r][c]==0 and c not in Cs:
                j=sum(1 for x in Cs if x<c)
                u(i*nc+j,(i+1)*nc+j)
    # holes in vertical separators link block(i,j)<->block(i,j+1)
    for c in Cs:
        j=sum(1 for x in Cs if x<c)
        for r in range(h):
            if g[r][c]==0 and r not in Rs:
                i=sum(1 for x in Rs if x<r)
                u(i*nc+j,i*nc+j+1)
    # count component sizes
    from collections import Counter
    cnt=Counter(f(i) for i in range(nr*nc))
    big=cnt.most_common(1)[0][0]
    # fill each block
    for i in range(nr):
        for j in range(nc):
            col=4 if f(i*nc+j)==big else 3
            for r in range(Rb[i]+1,Rb[i+1]):
                for c in range(Cb[j]+1,Cb[j+1]):
                    g[r][c]=col
    return g
```

Explanation of key steps:

- We identify the grid‐lines by finding the one nonzero value that appears “heavily” on certain rows/columns.  
- We then chop the grid into rectangular blocks between those lines.  
- Wherever a separator‐cell is zero, it’s a “hole” in the wall, so we union the two blocks on either side of that hole.  
- Finally we pick the largest connected set of blocks and color them with “4,” coloring all other blocks with “3,” leaving the separators at their original value.
