Here’s a very short “golfy” Python solution.  It finds the unique 1/4‐shape by looking at the bounding box of all 1’s, then pastes that entire shape (including its 4’s) centered on every other 4 in the grid:

```python
def p(g):
    val_mi=min(i for i,row in enumerate(g) for v in row if v==1)
    val_ma=max(i for i,row in enumerate(g) for v in row if v==1)
    val_mj=min(j for row in g for j,v in enumerate(row) if v==1)
    val_Mj=max(j for row in g for j,v in enumerate(row) if v==1)
    val_S=[r[val_mj:val_Mj+1] for r in g[val_mi:val_ma+1]]
    val_ch=(val_ma-val_mi)//2; val_cw=(val_Mj-val_mj)//2
    for val_i,row in enumerate(g):
        for val_j,val_v in enumerate(row):
            if val_v==4 and not(val_mi<=val_i<=val_ma and val_mj<=val_j<=val_Mj):
                for val_ii,val_r in enumerate(val_S):
                    for val_jj,val_w in enumerate(val_r):
                        if val_w:
                            g[val_i-val_ch+val_ii][val_j-val_cw+val_jj]=val_w
    return g
```

Explanation of the steps:

1. **Locate the “master” shape** by taking the bounding box of every cell equal to 1.  
2. **Extract** that sub‐grid (`val_S`) of 1’s and 4’s.  
3. Compute its **center** (`val_ch`, `val_cw`).  
4. **For each** 4 in the grid that lies *outside* that bounding box (these are the “seeds”), overlay the entire master shape so that its center lands on the seed.  
5. **Return** the modified grid.
