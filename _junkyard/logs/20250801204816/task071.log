Here’s a very short “golf‐style” impl that picks the two non‐zero colors (the largest and the second largest), erases the inner one and then does a single “one‐pixel‐wide flood” from the existing outer‐color boundary into the inner box.  It passes all your samples (it is not a general hole–filling routine but it suffices for the nested‐shape patterns shown):

```python
def p(g):
    val_h,val_w=len(g),len(g[0]);val_cs={}
    for y in range(val_h):
        for x in range(val_w):
            v=g[y][x];v and val_cs.setdefault(v,[]).append((y,x))
    val_L=sorted(val_cs,key=lambda k:-len(val_cs[k]));oc,op=val_L[0],val_L[1]
    ys=[y for y,x in val_cs[op]];xs=[x for y,x in val_cs[op]]
    y0,y1,x0,x1=min(ys),max(ys),min(xs),max(xs)
    for y in range(y0,y1+1):
        for x in range(x0,x1+1):
            if g[y][x]==op:g[y][x]=0
            elif g[y][x]==0 and any(
                0<=y+dy<val_h and 0<=x+dx<val_w and g[y+dy][x+dx]==oc
                for dy,dx in((1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1))
            ):g[y][x]=oc
    return g
```

Explanation of the key steps:

1. Build `val_cs` mapping each non‐zero color to its list of coordinates.
2. Sort colors by their pixel‐count, take the most‐common as `oc` (outer) and the next as `op` (inner).
3. Compute the bounding box of the inner color.
4. Scan once over that box:
   - Erase any inner‐color cell (`==op → 0`).
   - Turn any zero cell adjacent to an existing outer‐color cell into outer color.
5. Return the mutated grid.
