```python
def p(g):
    val_a,val_b=zip(*[(i,j)for i,row in enumerate(g)for j,x in enumerate(row)if x==2])
    val_a0,val_a1=min(val_a),max(val_a)
    val_b0,val_b1=min(val_b),max(val_b)
    return [[g[i][j] or 2 for j in range(val_b0,val_b1+1)]
            for i in range(val_a0,val_a1+1)]
```

Explanation of the rule:

1. Scan the entire input grid `g` to collect the coordinates `(i,j)` of every cell whose value is `2`.
2. Split those coordinates into two sequences:
   - `val_a`: the row‐indices of the `2`‐cells,
   - `val_b`: the column‐indices of the `2`‐cells.
3. Find the minimal and maximal row indices (`val_a0`, `val_a1`) and column indices (`val_b0`, `val_b1`).
4. Crop the grid to that bounding rectangle.
5. In the cropped output, any original zero is replaced by `2` (so that the entire background of the rectangle is filled with `2`), while nonzero values inside the rectangle are left unchanged.
