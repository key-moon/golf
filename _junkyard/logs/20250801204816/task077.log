Explanation of the rule:  
We mark (recolor to 4) every non‐zero, non‐2 cell that sits orthogonally adjacent to a 2.  All other cells stay as they were.  

Golfed Python (all user variables prefixed with `val_`):  
```
def p(val_g):
 for val_i,val_row in enumerate(val_g):
  for val_j,val_v in enumerate(val_row):
   if val_v*(val_v-2):
    try:
     if val_g[val_i+1][val_j]==2 or val_g[val_i-1][val_j]==2 or val_row[val_j+1]==2 or val_row[val_j-1]==2:val_row[val_j]=4
    except:pass
 return val_g
```
