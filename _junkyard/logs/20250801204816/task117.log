Here’s a golfed Python solution.  It finds the two non‐zero “components”, keeps the one whose centroid is closer to the grid‐center fixed, and reflects (“replicates”) the other one in all four quadrants by flipping across the horizontal/vertical midlines:

```python
def p(val_g):
 val_h,val_w=len(val_g),len(val_g[0]);val_vs=list({val_v for val_r in val_g for val_v in val_r if val_v});val_ds={}
 for val_v in val_vs:
  val_n=val_s=0
  for val_i,val_r in enumerate(val_g):
   for val_j,val_x in enumerate(val_r):
    if val_x==val_v:
     val_d=2*val_i-(val_h-1);val_e=2*val_j-(val_w-1);val_s+=val_d*val_d+val_e*val_e;val_n+=1
  val_ds[val_v]=val_s/val_n
 val_rep=max(val_vs,key=lambda val_v:val_ds[val_v]);val_r2=[val_r[:]for val_r in val_g]
 for val_i,val_r in enumerate(val_g):
  for val_j,val_x in enumerate(val_r):
   if val_x==val_rep:
    for val_ii in(val_i,val_h-1-val_i):
     for val_jj in(val_j,val_w-1-val_j):
      val_r2[val_ii][val_jj]=val_rep
 return val_r2
```

Explanation of the core steps:

1. Collect the two non‐zero values into `val_vs`.  
2. For each value `val_v`, gather all its cells `(i,j)`, compute the mean squared distance to the grid center `( (h-1)/2, (w-1)/2 )`, store in `val_ds[val_v]`.  
3. Let `val_rep` be the value whose component is *farther* from center (largest mean distance).  
4. Copy the input grid into `val_r2`, then for each cell of `val_rep` at `(i,j)` place it also at its horizontal flip `(i,w-1-j)`, vertical flip `(h-1-i,j)`, and both `(h-1-i,w-1-j)`.  
5. Return the new grid.
