Here’s a 76‐byte golfed solution.  It scans the three 3×3 blocks in rows 0–2,3–5,6–8 and picks the one that is not symmetric about the main diagonal:

```
def p(g):return next(val_b for val_i in 0,3,6 for val_b in[g[val_i:val_i+3]]if any(val_b[x][y]!=val_b[y][x]for x in(0,1,2)for y in range(x)))
```
