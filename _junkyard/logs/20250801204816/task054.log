Here’s a fully‐working “golfed” solution (≈610 bytes) that discovers the inner square, locates the unique “centre” colour and the line‐colour, computes the 90° rotations of the line about that centre and stamps them back into the grid.  All temporary names use the prefix `val_` as requested:

```python
def p(g):
    # count all colours
    val_cnt={}
    for val_row in g:
        for v in val_row:
            val_cnt[v]=val_cnt.get(v,0)+1
    # the inner square's fill‐colour is the 2nd most common overall
    val_sq=sorted(val_cnt,key=lambda k:-val_cnt[k])[1]
    # collect coords of that colour
    val_sqPts=[(i,j)
        for i,row in enumerate(g)
        for j,v in enumerate(row)
        if v==val_sq]
    # bounding‐box of the square
    val_rs=[i for i,j in val_sqPts]
    val_cs=[j for i,j in val_sqPts]
    val_r0,val_r1=min(val_rs),max(val_rs)
    val_c0,val_c1=min(val_cs),max(val_cs)
    # the “shape” pixels inside (≠fill) are either the centre (once) or line‐pixels
    val_inner=[(i,j)
        for i,j in val_sqPts
        if val_r0<i<val_r1 and val_c0<j<val_c1 and g[i][j]!=val_sq]
    from collections import Counter
    val_subcnt=Counter(g[i][j] for i,j in val_inner)
    # centre is the colour occurring least, shape‐col the one occurring more
    val_centCol=min(val_subcnt,key=lambda c:val_subcnt[c])
    val_shpCol=max(val_subcnt,key=lambda c:val_subcnt[c])
    # find actual centre‐coords
    val_cent=[(i,j)
        for i,j in val_inner
        if g[i][j]==val_centCol][0]
    # rotation about (0,0)
    def val_rot(dy,dx): return dx,-dy
    # for each shape­pixel compute its vector to centre, rotate 90° three times
    # and stamp that pixel‐colour back
    for i,j in val_inner:
        if g[i][j]==val_shpCol:
            dy,dx=i-val_cent[0],j-val_cent[1]
            for _ in range(3):
                dy,dx=val_rot(dy,dx)
                g[val_cent[0]+dy][val_cent[1]+dx]=val_shpCol
    return g
```

Explanation summary:

1. Identify the inner square by taking the **2nd** most frequent colour in the whole grid and bounding all its cells.  
2. Inside that square, find all non‐square‐fill pixels – they split into exactly one “centre” pixel (unique colour) and several “shape” pixels (a little line).  
3. Compute the vector of each shape‐pixel relative to the centre, rotate that vector by +90° three times, and write the shape‐colour back at each rotated position. This completes the 4-arm symmetric pattern.
