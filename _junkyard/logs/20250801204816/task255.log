Here’s a code‐golfy solver that finds the background color (the most common), flood‐fills all background pixels reachable from the outer border (marking them), and then any remaining background pixels must be true “holes” – we repaint those to color 3.  All locals (except the throwaway `_`) are `val_…` as requested:

```python
def p(g):
    val_h=len(g);val_w=len(g[0])
    val_cnt={}
    for val_row in g:
        for val_c in val_row:
            val_cnt[val_c]=val_cnt.get(val_c,0)+1
    val_bg=max(val_cnt,key=val_cnt.get)
    val_s=[]
    for val_i in range(val_h):
        for val_j in(0,val_w-1):
            if g[val_i][val_j]==val_bg:val_s.append((val_i,val_j))
    for val_j in range(val_w):
        for val_i in(0,val_h-1):
            if g[val_i][val_j]==val_bg:val_s.append((val_i,val_j))
    while val_s:
        val_i,val_j=val_s.pop()
        if g[val_i][val_j]==val_bg:
            g[val_i][val_j]=-1
            for val_dr,val_dc in((1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)):
                val_ni,val_nj=val_i+val_dr,val_j+val_dc
                if 0<=val_ni<val_h and 0<=val_nj<val_w and g[val_ni][val_nj]==val_bg:
                    val_s.append((val_ni,val_nj))
    for val_i in range(val_h):
        for val_j in range(val_w):
            if g[val_i][val_j]==val_bg: g[val_i][val_j]=3
            elif g[val_i][val_j]==-1: g[val_i][val_j]=val_bg
    return g
```

Explanation of the main steps:

1. Count all colors to pick `val_bg` = the most frequent (the “true” background).  
2. Seed a stack `val_s` with every background pixel on the grid‐border.  
3. Pop‐and‐spread: flood‐fill only those border‐connected background pixels by marking them `-1`.  
4. Any remaining cells still equal to `val_bg` are holes – paint them `3`.  
5. Restore the marked exterior pixels from `-1` back to the original `val_bg`.  

This exactly fills the “hole” inside the enclosing shape with color 3, and leaves everything else untouched.
