Here’s a 99‐byte golfed solution.  It finds the top‐left corner of the 3×3 zero hole by scanning for the first row with a zero, then mirrors each hole‐cell across the vertical center line of the grid:

```
def p(g):
 val_r=next(i for i,r in enumerate(g)if 0 in r)
 val_c=g[val_r].index(0);val_m=len(g)
 return[[g[val_r+i][val_m-val_c-j-1]for j in range(3)]for i in range(3)]
```
