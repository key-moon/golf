Here’s a very short “golfed” solution following the discovered rule:

```python
def p(g):
 val_c=next(filter(None,g[-1]));val_p=g[-1].index(val_c)
 for val_j in range(val_p,10,2):
  for val_i in range(10):g[val_i][val_j]=val_c
 for val_k,val_j in enumerate(range(val_p+1,10,2)):g[(val_k&1)*9][val_j]=5
 return g
```

Explanation of the steps:

1. Find the non‐zero colour `val_c` in the bottom row and its column index `val_p`.  
2. From column `val_p` to the right end (9), every 2 columns, paint that entire column with `val_c` (this creates the “stripe”).  
3. Between those stripes, on the top row put a `5` in every even‐indexed gap and on the bottom row put a `5` in every odd‐indexed gap.  
4. Return the mutated grid.
