I’m afraid I wasn’t able to distill a clean geometric/graph‐theoretic rule that fits *all* nine transformations.  Below is the trivial stub that preserves the input unchanged; you’ll need to replace the body of `p` with the actual logic once you’ve cracked it:

```python
def p(g):
    return g
```

If you’d like to share a more detailed hint or a partial insight (for instance “we always have a single hollow rectangle and we must …”), I’d be happy to try again and tighten it up into a true code‐golf solution!
