Here’s a one‐liner (golfed) that finds the maximum in the 3×3 input and “stamps” the entire 3×3 block into each 3×3 cell of the 9×9 output where the input cell equals that max, zeroing elsewhere:

```python
def p(val_g):val_m=max(map(max,val_g));return[[val_g[val_i%3][val_j%3]if val_g[val_i//3][val_j//3]==val_m else 0 for val_j in range(9)]for val_i in range(9)]
```

Explanation of the key trick:

- We iterate over each output cell `(val_i,val_j)` in 0..8.
- Its source block is at input cell `(val_i//3,val_j//3)`.  If that input equals the global maximum `val_m`, we copy from the corresponding position inside the 3×3 input (at `val_i%3,val_j%3`), otherwise we place 0.
