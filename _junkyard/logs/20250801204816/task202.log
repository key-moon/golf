Here’s a very short “golfed” solution.  It walks down the rows in contiguous “stripes” of the same background colour, collects all zero‐columns seen in that stripe, and then draws vertical zero‐lines through each stripe at those columns:

```python
def p(g):
 val_i=0
 while val_i<len(g):
  val_bg=next(v for v in g[val_i] if v)
  val_j=val_i
  while val_j<len(g)and next(v for v in g[val_j] if v)==val_bg:val_j+=1
  val_C={y for r in g[val_i:val_j]for y,z in enumerate(r)if z<1}
  for r in g[val_i:val_j]:
   for y in val_C:r[y]=0
  val_i=val_j
 return g
```

Explanation of the core steps:

1.  val_i scans the starting row of each stripe.  
2.  We find the background colour val_bg by grabbing the first non‐zero entry in that row.  
3.  We extend val_j downwards so long as subsequent rows share the same val_bg.  
4.  We collect all column indices y where a zero appears in any row of the stripe into set val_C.  
5.  We then set those columns to zero in every row of the stripe.  
6.  Advance val_i to val_j (start of the next stripe) and repeat.
