```python
def p(g):a,b=len(g),len(g[0]);c=[any(x)for x in zip(*g)];return[[g[i%a][j%b]or 8*c[j%b]for j in range(b*2)]for i in range(a*2)]
```

Explanation of the rule (in brief):

1. Let the input be an `a×b` grid `g`.
2. Compute a boolean list `c` of length `b` where `c[j]` is `True` iff column `j` of `g` contains at least one nonzero.
3. Build a `2a×2b` output by repeating `g` in both dimensions (`i%a`, `j%b`).  
   - If `g[i%a][j%b] != 0`, keep that value.
   - Else, if `c[j%b]` is `True` (the original column had some nonzero), fill with 8.
   - Otherwise fill with 0.
