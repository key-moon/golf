Here’s a very compact solution that locates the single “odd‐color” cell inside its larger cluster, determines which of the four cardinal directions points into the cluster, reverses that to get the “fill” direction, then marches out to the grid edge painting the odd color:

```python
def p(g):
    h,w=len(g),len(g[0]);f=sum(g,[]);a=list({*f}-{0})
    x=[c for c in a if f.count(c)==1][0];y=[c for c in a if c!=x][0]
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(w):
            if g[r][c]==x: break
     else
        break
    for dr,dc in[(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
        if 0<=r+dr<h and 0<=c+dc<w and g[r+dr][c+dc]==y:
            dr,dc=-dr,-dc
            break
    while 0<=r+dr<h and 0<=c+dc<w:
        r+=dr; c+=dc; g[r][c]=x
    return g
```

Explanation of the main steps:
1. Flatten `g` into `f` and collect its nonzero colors into `a`.
2. Pick `x` as the color that occurs exactly once, and `y` as the other nonzero color.
3. Find the coordinates `(r,c)` of the single `x`.
4. Look at each of the four neighbors; wherever you see `y` you know that direction points *into* the cluster, so you reverse it to get the fill direction `(dr,dc)`.
5. March from `(r,c)` outwards in `(dr,dc)`, coloring every cell you hit with `x` until you exit the grid.
