Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.

Example 1:

Input:
0 7 0
0 0 7
0 7 7
Output:
0 7 0 0 7 0
0 0 7 7 0 0
0 7 7 7 7 0

Example 1:

Input:
0 0 0
0 7 7
0 0 0
Output:
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 7 7 7 0
0 0 0 0 0 0

Example 1:

Input:
0 0 0
7 0 0
0 0 0
Output:
0 0 0 0 0 0
7 0 0 0 0 7
0 0 0 0 0 0

Example 1:

Input:
7 7 0
0 7 0
0 0 7
Output:
7 7 0 0 7 7
0 7 0 0 7 0
0 0 7 7 0 0

Example 1:

Input:
0 0 7
7 7 0
0 7 7
Output:
0 0 7 7 0 0
7 7 0 0 7 7
0 7 7 7 7 0

Example 1:

Input:
7 0 0
0 7 7
0 0 0
Output:
7 0 0 0 0 7
0 7 7 7 7 0
0 0 0 0 0 0

Example 1:

Input:
7 7 7
7 7 0
7 7 0
Output:
7 7 7 7 7 7
7 7 0 0 7 7
7 7 0 0 7 7

Example 1:

Input:
7 7 7

7 0 7
Output:
7 7 7 7 7 7
7 0 0 0 0 7
7 0 7 7 0 7


Write the **short** Python code in code golf manners that performs the transformation according to the rule in following format: `def p(g): ...`. Note that input and output are passed by 2D arrays. Use `val_` as a prefix for all variables except `_`. Avoid line breaks as much as possible.
